All the grammar and syntax rule file *.g4 are copied from :

1. Set up Antlr on Linux Ubuntu

This is very easy, just following the guideline on the official website.
https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md

The following is copied from the "Unix" part.


(1). Install Java (version 1.6 or higher)
(2). Download

$ cd /usr/local/lib
$ curl -O https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar

Or just download in browser from website: https://www.antlr.org/download.html and put it somewhere rational like /usr/local/lib.

    Add antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar to your CLASSPATH:

$ export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"

It's also a good idea to put this in your .bash_profile or whatever your startup script is.

    Create aliases for the ANTLR Tool, and TestRig.

$ alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool'
$ alias grun='java -Xmx500M -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'

Add the environment variables and the alias in the ~/.bashrc is more effective.

2. And Hello.g4 is a simple grammar rule, and Hello.play is just a simple test case.

antlr4 Hello.g4
javac *.java
grun Hello tokens -tokens Hello.play

3. antlrtest/PlayScript.g4 is a syntax rule

antlr4 PlayScript.g4
javac *.java
cd ..
grun antlrtest.PlayScript expression -gui

Note: This is an input console. Then enter "age + 10 * 2 + 10", and press Ctrl + D.
An AST will be shown on the screen.

This is really COOL!!!
